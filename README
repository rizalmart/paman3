Overview

   PulseAudio Manager (paman) is a simple GTK frontend for the
   [25]PulseAudio sound server.

   Everybody loves [26]screenshots.

Current Status

   With the current version of paman you may browser most of PulseAudio's
   internals. There is support for changing volume of sinks and sink
   outputs. You're able to play samples from the sample cache.

Documentation

   There is not much to say. Just run paman and see yourself.

Requirements

   Currently, paman is tested on Linux only.

   paman was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux "testing" from
   November 2004, it should work on most other Linux distributions (and
   maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf for source code
   configuration.

   paman requires [27]gtkmm and glademmm installed.

   Obviously paman requires an installation of [28]PulseAudio (version
   0.9.5).

   If you want to have the "Volume Meter" buttons working, your need to
   install [29]pavumeter.

Installation

   As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
   ./configure inside the distribution directory for configuring the
   source tree. After that you should run make for compilation and make
   install (as root) for installation of paman.

Acknowledgements

   None so far.
